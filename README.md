# Sales Forecasting in Excel (2020–2024)

## 📈 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a time series forecasting model in Microsoft Excel to predict quarterly sales data for the year 2024. Historical data from 2020 to 2023 was analyzed using a range of trend and seasonal forecasting techniques to identify patterns and build accurate forward-looking models.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Line & Seasonal Charts
- MSE (Mean Squared Error) as performance metric

## 🔍 Methods Implemented
The following models were built and evaluated:
- **Holt’s Linear Trend Method**
- **Holt-Winters Additive Method** (trend + additive seasonality)
- **Holt-Winters Multiplicative Method**
- **Linear Trend Forecasting**
- **Quadratic Trend Forecasting**
- **Seasonal Indices Decomposition**
- **Quadratic Trend with Seasonal Effects**

## 📊 Features & Highlights
- Modeled and forecasted **quarterly sales** from 2020 to 2024
- Built dynamic tables and charts for model comparison and visualization
- Optimized smoothing constants (alpha, beta, gamma) to reduce forecasting error
- Used **MSE** to compare model accuracy and stability across forecast horizons

## ✅ Results
- **Best model(s)** selected based on lowest MSE and visual forecast consistency
- Forecast for **2024** generated with adjusted seasonal and trend components
- Provided a robust framework to apply to future time series forecasting problems

## 📁 Files Included
- `Sales_Forecast_Excel.xlsx` – complete workbook with raw data, transformed inputs, forecasting models, and visuals
- Screenshots (optional: add as PNG/JPEG in a `/screenshots` folder)
- This `README.md`

## 🔗 Future Work / Extensions
- Automate parameter tuning with Excel VBA or Python
- Apply models to monthly or weekly data
- Integrate external drivers (e.g., marketing spend, economic indicators)

## 🧠 Learnings
This project deepened my understanding of time series forecasting concepts including trend modeling, seasonality, smoothing techniques, and the trade-offs between additive vs. multiplicative seasonality in business forecasting.
